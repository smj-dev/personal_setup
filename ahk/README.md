# Auto hotkey setup
These are intended for remapping keys in environments where the it is not practical
to do a powertoys or keyboard remap on windows setups. 

1. Download and install auto hotkey v2 from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Copy the desired scripts from this directory to the windows startup folder 
(win+r to run and type "shell:startup" to open directory)

Note: The dellCopilotRemap.ahk script maps copilot to win and should only be copied on dell computers with a copilot button.
